  <h1>Irrigation Project</h1>
     <p>This year we are collaborating with students from the Engineering
     department at Warwick University to solve one of the largest practical
     challenges the site faces every year… Irrigation!</p>

     <p>Project specifications are as below.</p>
     <p> Fenced Area - Width: 20.4M. Length: 13.6M. </p>
     <p> Polytunnel - Width: 4.4M. Length: 10.2M. </p>

     <p>Water Requirements: At an average of 17L per raised bed with around
     22.5 raised beds in total, the volume of water required to cover the entire
     area would be around 380L. This is for the biggest use case scenario, on a
     very hot day that would dry up the plants. Regular usage will be lower and
     as such may not constitute the need for a water tank which holds maximum
     capacity. </P>

     <p>The polytunnel will only require a maximum of two loads of 50L of water
     with the same extreme environments on a hot day. Majority of the time the
     load case will be around half of the amount stated. </p>

     <p>Our Requirements: Must be an off-grid system with the aim of being
     sustainable to stick true to the society’s culture. It’s important to try
     and emulate the values of sustainability and self-sufficiency, something
     which is so important in a world where national infrastructure sometimes
     falls short and where we want to remind people of their personal power as
     a collective to problem-solve and get things done!</p>

     <p>This project is just as much political and educational as it is practical.</p>
